# Obsidian-Win98-Edition
A windows 98 makeover theme for Obsidian made out of spite of "modern" User Interfaces which are made for tablets, mobiles and other touch screens. 

This css takes everything from https://jdan.github.io/98.css/ and some from https://packard-belle.netlify.app/
This https://copy.sh/v86/?profile=windows98 is the real windows 98 running in browser to compare and fix stuff. 


Current Look (WIP)
