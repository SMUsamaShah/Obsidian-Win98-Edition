# Obsidian-Win98-Edition
A windows 98 makeover theme for Obsidian made out of spite for "modern" User Interfaces which believe in 'bigger is better' and see all displays as touch screens.

This css takes everything from https://jdan.github.io/98.css/ and some from https://packard-belle.netlify.app/
This https://copy.sh/v86/?profile=windows98 is the real windows 98 running in browser to compare and fix stuff. 


Current Look (WIP)
